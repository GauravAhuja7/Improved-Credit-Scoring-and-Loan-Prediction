# Improved-Credit-Scoring-and-Loan-Prediction

Overview
This project aims to revolutionize the lending industry by developing an AI-Enhanced Credit Scoring and Loan Prediction System. Our innovative solution leverages advanced artificial intelligence to analyze a broader range of data points, providing a more accurate and fair assessment of an individual’s creditworthiness. This system incorporates non-traditional data such as bank statements, utility bills, and rent payments, in addition to traditional credit data, to help lenders make better decisions about loan approvals and interest rates.

Uniqueness
Key Features:
Diverse Data Sources: Unlike traditional credit scoring models, our system integrates non-traditional data points, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of an individual’s financial behavior.
Sophisticated AI Algorithms: Utilizing machine learning techniques, our model continuously improves and adapts, making it more robust and reliable over time.
Analyzed Data Includes:
Bank Statements
Utility Bills
Rent Payments
By considering these data points, the system creates a holistic picture of a borrower’s financial health, uncovering hidden strengths and weaknesses that traditional methods might miss.

Hackathon
This project was developed as part of the HumanAlze Hackathon, aiming to foster financial inclusion and reduce default rates through improved credit scoring and loan prediction.
